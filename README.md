I got the inspiration for this project from D.D Burns's book: "Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy"; This book helped me significantly reduce negative states like depression, anxiety, and procrastination. It wasn't solo sours of help but, it gave a significant boost.

In short, Burns suggests that strong negative states are caused by thoughts that contain mostly negative interpretations and biases. Noticing and replacing biased thoughts helps to feel better.

While the book describes the theory and how to work it, it is difficult for me to notice and resolve biases. I believe that third-party opinion is essential in such work, and the help of a therapist is not always feasible for many reasons, so there is plenty of space for improvements in terms of accessibility and quality of self-help. 

I see this project in three main stages:
Secure personal information
Give tools for self-help based on CBT* methods
Develop algorithms that help find and resolve biases

I see meaning in this project.  At this moment, I can't implement many essential features, so simply working on strengthening my programming skills.
